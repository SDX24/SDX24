### 🏆 Development Philosophy

> "Code is poetry, but good code is poetry with automated spell-check, linting, and a strict review process."

I believe in:

- ✅ Automated quality gates over manual reviews
- ✅ Type safety over runtime errors
- ✅ Tests over hope
- ✅ Documentation over memory
- ✅ Continuous improvement over perfection
